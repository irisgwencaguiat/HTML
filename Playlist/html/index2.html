                        <br>
                            You were my conscience, so solid, now you're like water<br>
                            We started drowning, not like we'd sink any further<br>
                            But I let my heart go, it's somewhere down at the bottom<br>
                            But I'll get a new one and come back for the hope that you've stolen<br>
                            I'll stop the whole world, I'll stop the whole world<br>
                            From turning into a monster and eating us alive<br>
                            Don't you ever wonder how we survive?<br>
                            Well now that your gone, the world is ours<br>
                            I'm only human, I've got a skeleton in me<br>
                            But I'm not the villain, despite what you're always preaching<br>
                            Call me a traitor, I'm just collecting your victims<br>
                            They're getting stronger, I hear them calling<br>
                            I'll stop the whole world, I'll stop the whole world<br>
                            From turning into a monster and eating us alive<br>
                            Don't you ever wonder how we survive?<br>
                            Well now that your gone, the world is ours<br>
                            Well you find your strength in solutions<br>
                            But I liked the tension<br>
                            And not always knowing the answers<br>
                            But you're gonna lose it, you're gonna lose it<br>
                            I'll stop the whole world, I'll stop the whole world<br>
                            From turning into a monster, and eating us alive<br>
                            Don't you ever wonder how we survive?<br>
                            Well now that your gone, the world<br>
                            I'll stop the whole world, I'll stop the whole world<br>
                            From turning into a monster, eating us alive<br>
                            Don't you ever wonder how we survive?<br>
                            Now that your gone, the world is ours<br>
