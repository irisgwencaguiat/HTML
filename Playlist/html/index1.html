                            The Goo Goo Dolls are an American rock band formed in 1986[3] in Buffalo, New York, by guitarist/vocalist Johnny Rzeznik, bassist/vocalist Robby Takac, and drummer George Tutuska.[4] Mike Malinin was the band's drummer from December 1994 until December 27, 2013 (but not made an official member until 1998). Although renowned for their commercially successful 1998 single "Iris", they have had several other notable and popular singles including "Name" and "Naked" from 1995's A Boy Named Goo, "Slide", "Black Balloon", "Dizzy", and "Broadway" from 1998's Dizzy Up the Girl, "Here Is Gone" from 2002's Gutterflower, "Better Days", "Give a Little Bit", and "Stay with You" from 2006's Let Love In (although "Give a Little Bit" was originally released on the 2004 live CD/DVD album Live in Buffalo: July 4th, 2004), and "Home" from 2010's Something for the Rest of Us. The Goo Goo Dolls have had 19 top ten singles on various charts,[5] and have sold more than 12 million albums worldwide.</li>

                        <br>
                             And I'd give up forever to touch you <br>
                            'Cause I know that you feel me somehow <br>
                            You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be <br>
                            And I don't want to go home right now <br>
                            And all I can taste is this moment <br>
                            And all I can breathe is your life <br>
                            And sooner or later it's over <br>
                            I just don't wanna miss you tonight <br>
                            And I don't want the world to see me <br>
                            'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <br>
                            When everything's meant to be broken <br>
                            I just want you to know who I am <br> 
                            And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming <br>
                            Or the moment of truth in your lies <br>
                            When everything feels like the movies <br>
                            Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive <br>
                            And I don't want the world to see me <br>
                            'Cause I don't think that they'd u <br>nderstand <br>
                            When everything's meant to be broken <br>
                            I just want you to know who I am <br> <br>
                            And I don't want the world to see me <br>
                            'Cause I don't think that they'd understand<br>
                            When everything's meant to be broken <br>
                            I just want you to know who I am <br>
                            And I don't want the world to see me <br>
                            'Cause I don't think that they'd understand<br>
                            When everything's meant to be broken <br>
                            I just want you to know who I am <br>
                            I just want you to know who I am <br>
