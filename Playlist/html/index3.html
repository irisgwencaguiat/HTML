                        <br>
                            I've been up in the air<br>
                            Out of my head<br>
                            Stuck in a moment of emotion I've destroyed<br>
                            Is this the end I feel?<br>
                            Up in the air<br>
                            Fucked up our life<br>
                            All of the laws I've broken, loves that I've sacrificed<br>
                            Is this the end?<br>
                            I wrap my hands around you neck so tight with love, love<br>
                            A thousand times I've tempted fate<br>
                            A thousand times I've played this game<br>
                            A thousand times that I have said today, today, today<br>
                            I've been up in the air<br>
                            Lost in the night<br>
                            I wouldn't trade out for you lies you lost for my life<br>
                            Is this the end<br>
                            You were the love of my life, the darkness, the light<br>
                            This is a portrait of the tortured you and I<br>
                            Is this the, is this the, is this the end?<br>
                            I wrap my hands around you neck so tight with love, love, love<br>
                            A thousand times I've tempted fate<br>
                            A thousand times I've played this game<br>
                            A thousand times that I have said today, today, today<br>
                            A thousand times I've tempted fate<br>
                            A thousand times I've played this game<br>
                            A thousand times that I have said today, today, today<br>
                            I've been up in the air<br>
                            Is this the end I feel?<br>
                            Up in the air<br>
                            Chasing a dream so real<br>
                            I've been up in the air (I wrap my hands around you neck)<br>
                            Is this the end I feel<br>
                            Up in the air<br>
                            Chasing a dream, Chasing a dream<br>
                            Take no more<br>
                            Take no more<br>
                            Take no more<br>
                            I'll take no more<br>
                            A thousand times I've tempted fate (I'll take no more)<br>
                            A thousand times I've played this game (I'll take no more)<br>
                            A thousand times that I have said today, today, today (I'll take no more)<br>
                            Today (I wrap my hands)<br>
                            Today (hands around)<br>
                            Today (your neck)<br>
                            Today (with love, love)<br>
                            Today (I'll wrap my hands)<br>
                            Today (around your neck)<br>
                            Today (with love, love)<br>
